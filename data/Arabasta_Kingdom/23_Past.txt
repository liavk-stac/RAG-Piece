[] Arabasta has a long, and illustrious history. According to Nico Robin, the country has existed for 500 years before the Void Century, perhaps even longer. The Royal Palace of Alubarna predates the kingdom itself, having existed for around 4000 years.&#91;18&#93; 800 years ago, the Nefertari royal family was one of the twenty royal families who founded the World Government. Notably, they are the only family to remain in rule of their own country, rather than moving to Mary Geoise&#160;and letting new royalty take over.&#91;4&#93; The Poneglyph, initially interpreted by Nico Robin, seemed to describe Arabasta's early history.&#91;19&#93; Robin, as Miss All-Sunday, recited a few events, until Crocodile interrupted her, not interested in the history of the country: Kahira (カヒラ, Kahira?) conquers Arabasta (Arabasta's history, date: Age of Heaven Year 239. Information supplied by Nico Robin)&#91;19&#93; The Bitein Dynasty of Taymar (テイマーのビテイン朝, Teimā no Bitein Asa?) begins its rule (Arabasta's history, date: Year 260. Information supplied by Nico Robin)&#91;19&#93; In the VIZ manga: "Tymar of the Bitein Dynasty took the throne." In the Funimation adaptations: "Taymer ruled the Bitain Dynasty." In the 4Kids dub: "Highden of Teema began his long rule." The Great Taph Temple (タフ大聖堂, Tafu Taiseidō?, 4Kids: "Tafu Temple"; Funimation: "Taff Cathedral") was completed in Erumalu (Arabasta's history, date: Year 306. Information supplied by Nico Robin)&#91;19&#93; The Hero of Oltea (オルテアの英雄, Orutea no Eiyū?, Funimation: "Oltia"), Mamudin (マムディン, Mamudin?, Funimation: "Mamdin")... (Arabasta's history, date: Year 325. Information supplied by Nico Robin, however she was not allowed to finish the sentence.)&#91;19&#93; However, it was later revealed that it contained only the whereabouts of Pluton, not the historical account.&#91;20&#93;
