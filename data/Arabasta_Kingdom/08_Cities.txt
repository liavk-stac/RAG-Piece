[] Cities are central gathering places for the citizens of Arabasta. Arabasta is a very old country; there are few oases, but where they exist a town is likely built around it. Some older cities are now in ruins, while new ones also exist. The Sandora Desert is extremely desolate, and is usually only entered for travel. The cities are further divided by the Sandora River, which splits the country in half. There are 7 known cities in Arabasta (8 if non-canon is included). Two of them are port towns situated on the south and east sides of the island.
