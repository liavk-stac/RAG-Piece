[] There remains some debate over whether the kingdom should properly be romanized Arabasta or Alabasta, as katakana tends to be infamously fickle between R and L pronunciations: Alabasta was the manga's earliest romanization, used in the Whisky Peak&#91;1&#93; and Little Garden Arcs (and, much later, the Cover Page of Chapter 611). It is universally used by the 4Kids, VIZ, and Funimation translations. Arabasta came into use with the manga's supplementary maps in Volume 19 and 20, and was favored by many fan translators. Later, the Whole Cake Island Saga depicted it&#91;23&#93; on the sails of Vivi's Levely ship, and it is currently regarded as the canonical spelling. Note that all of these were edited to read Alabasta in Viz's translation. Alabaster was, uniquely, used in the Funimation localization of One Piece: Unlimited Adventure.
