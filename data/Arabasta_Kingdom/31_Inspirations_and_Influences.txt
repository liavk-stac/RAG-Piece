[] According to Eiichiro Oda, Arabasta was inspired by ancient Egypt.&#91;24&#93; The Egyptian influence is evident in building and clothing designs, the hieroglyphs, the names of the royal family, the retainers, and food mentioned (knafeh, mulukhiyah). While less significant than the Egyptian references, some elements also draw from broader Arab and Islamic cultural heritage. In Alubarna, dome-shaped structures are prominent, reflecting a feature common across Islamic architecture, including Egypt. The design of Alubarna’s royal palace closely resembles the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. The circular plan of Alubarna also bears a strong resemblance to the historic Round city of Baghdad, the 8th-century Abbasid capital, which was designed with concentric walls and a grand central complex. The travel guide Rurubu One Piece published by the travel agency JTB Corporation, notes a possible inspiration between Alubarna and the city of Jodhpur. Rurubu also connects Rain Dinners with Luxor Las Vegas (an Egyptian-inspired casino), as well as Yuba with the Great Mosque of Djenné in Mali.
