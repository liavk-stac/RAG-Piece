[] Further information: Monkey D. Luffy/Gallery Luffy is a young man of average height with shaggy black hair, round black eyes, and a slim muscular build. He is renowned for his trademark yellow straw hat with a red hatband (from which he gets his epithet "Straw Hat Luffy"), which was lent to him when he was young by the legendary pirate captain, "Red-Haired" Shanks, who in turn received it from Gol D. Roger. Before the timeskip, his main outfit consisted of a red vest with three gold buttons, light blue denim shorts cut off just above his knees, and tan sandals. Luffy also has a scar with two stitches underneath his left eye, which he earned as a child by stabbing his face to show Shanks that he was tough enough to be a pirate. He was severely wounded by Akainu in the Summit War of Marineford, leaving a large X-shaped scar on his chest.
